Hello, I'm MilkFrame! I collect and maintain information about various Roblox games, for historical preservation and educational purposes. As someone who loves nostalgia, I'm motivated to conserve this information across my projects, so it can be fondly remembered in the future. Below is a list of all my projects to date:

| **Project** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [**MilkFrame Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@MilkFrame) | A collection of <ins>timelapse videos</ins>, showcasing player activity within various Roblox games.<br/>(_currently on hiatus_) |
| [**MilkBox**](https://github.com/MilkFrame/MilkBox) | A database of <ins>in-game information & leaderboards</ins> for various Roblox games. |
| [**EpicArchive**](https://github.com/MilkFrame/EpicArchive) | An archive of <ins>player-related data</ins> for various Roblox games. |
